        <h1>The green bike</h1>
<h2>Saturday, February 8, 2020</h2>
<p>I went to play basketball to the park of Macultepec, meanwhile, I was going
there, I was thinking that maybe I should watch some basketball videos on
Youtube to learn to play better. </p>
<p>When I was already playing, I threw the ball to some bikes parked in the
corner, accidentally I hit one green color bike, which felt to the ground;
some guys came to see what's going on, among them, a girl, who was precisely
the owner of the green bike... I told her that I was interested in MTB, she
told me that they knew some routes, but not precisely MTB routes... </p>
<p>She asked me about my phone number to stay in contact and go to some rides
together, I think the other guys were her brothers... I was trying to remember
my phone number from Germany, to impress her, but I couldn't, then I woke up.</p>
<p>So, I will buy a basket ball today.</p>
