<p>It is time to stop, and reflect. I arrived possibly to the half of the way, so,
it is a good moment to look back and see the many things that I have done
wrong, and the few things that I have done well. </p>
<p>This is merely a personal reflection, I am making public, because, yep, the
people put its stuff in internet. Hopefully, will be useful for my niece in
some years, so, I dedicate these words to you Karol, some years in the future.</p>
<p>I am trying to put together the noise from last years, piece things together,
or as someone said, connect the points.</p>
<h2>Mexico, the roots</h2>
<p>I dream, since the most inner of my hearth that Mexico will change, that a
new and different Mexico is possible. It is worth to dream about it. But
recently, I started to think, that maybe not, maybe Mexico will never change.</p>
<p>I did believe in the political project of the left, at this point, after some
time they (we) arrived to the power.</p>
<h2>The PhD and Data Science</h2>
<p>For first time in my life I am not sure about the doctorate.</p>
<p>It is depressive to tell it, but I am not more in love with science as I was at
the beggining.</p>
<p>I was not enjoying the path in too many stages; I became to Germany, waiting to 
learn</p>
<p>%This has caused me to doubt every single decision I’ve made over the past few years</p>
<p>%<em>Un día eres joven y al día siguiente estás reflexionando sobre la vida.</em></p>
<p>% to say the least</p>
<p>% Thinking outside of the box</p>
<p><em>No te revientes reata, por que (no) es el último tirón.</em></p>
<h2>My health</h2>
<p>% Put here the image of thirty zone</p>
<p>It is when you start to care about your health, about the future, about the
happiness.</p>
<h2>Loneliness and love</h2>
<p>During a lot of time, loneliness was not a problem, I truly enjoyed to be alone
in the highschool, I read a lot during that period.</p>
<p>I have been alone most of time during these thirty years, at the middle of my
twenties, this became a horrible thing. </p>
<p>Happily, I still have few friends that helped me in hard moments, so, I am not
totally alone.</p>
<p>Being the good and turning the other cheek does not work, at least not for me,
at least not in every case. Why is so hard to find real friends?</p>
<p>I am feeling empty. <em>For me is too complicate (it is impossible) to forgive</em>.</p>
<p>I have been in love with Irasu and Miriam during the highschool, and Valeria during the highschool. </p>
<p>The thing with Irasu never worked, she hit me. With Miriam and Valeria
was different, I was not able to give the last step. Yes, I am a mother fucker.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit to write the name of the girls, very likely they won't read this.</p>
<p>And then, happened again, I fall in love during last year. I even
learned to ride a bike because of that, and that is interesting, because I
never tried to ride a bike after I fell down so badly when I was a kid. Once
again, as with Irasu, I was hitted. Even worse, I was swinged. As one song in
Spanish says: <strong>Ácabame de matar, pa' qué me dejas herido</strong>. </p>
<h2></h2>
<p>I became thirty on January, I was alone in my room, I woke up late, when it was
already dark, it was too cold. It was horrible and it has been horrible since
then. I was alone, it was one week after the New Year eve, when I was also
alone, and I ate a ramen soup, it was one week after Christmas, where I was also
alone.</p>
<p>I have lost the motivation. I really don't want to live anymore. </p>
