&lt;h2&gt;Saturday, February 8, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to play basketball to the park of Macultepec, meanwhile, I was going
there, I was thinking that maybe I should watch some basketball videos on
Youtube to learn to play better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was already playing, I threw the ball to some bikes parked in the
corner, accidentally I hit one green color bike, which felt to the ground;
some guys came to see what's going on, among them, a girl, who was precisely
the owner of the green bike... I told her that I was interested in MTB, she
told me that they knew some routes, but not precisely MTB routes... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked me about my phone number to stay in contact and go to some rides
together, I think the other guys were her brothers... I was trying to remember
my phone number from Germany, to impress her, but I couldn't, then I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I will buy a basket ball today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="experiments"></category></entry></feed>
